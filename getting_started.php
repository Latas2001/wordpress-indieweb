    <h2>Themes</h2>

<p>Some WordPress themes are compatible with microformats. The Indieweb uses microformats2, the latest version, to mark up sites so that they can be interpreted by other sites when retrieved. Most parsers will fall back onto the older format if available.</p>

<p.Formatting your site so other sites can consume the information allows for the communications Indieweb sites support. For example, a class of u-like-of added to a link to a site you liked to indicates that relationship.</p>

<p>There is only one theme in the WordPress repository that is fully microformats2 compliant. That is Sempress.</p>

    <h2>What is the Indieweb?</h2>
